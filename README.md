## Project Overview

The project aims to:
- Analyze customer behavior through review patterns
- Segment customers based on their reviewing patterns
- Detect potentially fake reviews using unsupervised learning
- Perform sentiment analysis on reviews

## Dependencies

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import nltk
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
```

## Data Preprocessing

1. Text Processing:
```python
# NLTK preprocessing
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
```

2. Custom Functions:
```python
def token_stop_pos(text):
    tags = pos_tag(word_tokenize(text))
    newlist = []
    for word, tag in tags:
        if word.lower() not in stop_words:
            newlist.append(tuple([word, pos_dict.get(tag[0])]))
    return newlist
```

## Customer Segmentation

1. Feature Engineering:
- Review counts per customer
- Average expenditure
- Positive/negative review ratio
- Review length statistics

2. K-means Clustering:
```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=6, random_state=47)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(dfs1[columns])
```

## Fake Review Detection

1. Text Vectorization:
```python
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2), max_df=0.9)
text_features = tfidf.fit_transform(dfl['summaryreview_lemma'].values)
```

2. Anomaly Detection:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
isolation_forest = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
outlier_labels = isolation_forest.fit_predict(outlier_detection_df)
```

## Results and Analysis

### Customer Segments:
- Cluster 0: Moderate reviewers
- Cluster 1: Negative reviewers (potential fake)
- Cluster 2: High-volume reviewers
- Clusters 3-5: Various authentic patterns

### Fake Review Indicators:
1. Extreme sentiment scores
2. Unusual review lengths
3. Irregular voting patterns
4. Suspicious customer behavior

## Conclusions

1. Customer behavior patterns can effectively identify suspicious reviewing activity
2. Combined analysis of text features and numerical metrics improves fake review detection
3. Unsupervised learning techniques successfully segment customers and identify anomalies

## Future Improvements

1. Include more features for analysis
2. Implement supervised learning with labeled data
3. Add real-time detection capabilities
4. Enhance visualization techniques
